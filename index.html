        <h1>Project background</h1>
             <p>This project attempts to analyse a dataset obtained from Kaggle, specifically focusing on the distribution of global Powerplants, and present the various information within 
          in an easier to read visual format.</p>
          <h2>Dataset used: </h2>
           <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jaytilala/global-power-plant">Link to the Dataset used </a>
             <p>The dataset used for this project displays powerplants around the globe, the type of fuels they are operating, commissioning year, and estimated electrical production. </p>
          <h2>Dataset documentation</h2>
            <a href="Powerplant_Dataset/A_Global_Database_of_Power_Plants.pdf">Documentation provided by the creators of the Dataset. </a>
             <p>Documentation from the creators of the Dataset provided with it, explaining the methodology used in its collection and production and potential flaws of the dataset. For example, as the dataset 
          is created from publically avaiable information, one of the issues raised in the documentation raises is that some types of renewable electrical Generation may be undercounted in the dataset, due to underreporting of newer
          and smaller facilites, such as solar and wind. This leads to these types of fuels potentially having lower counts within the dataset. In addition, as another example, certain data, such actual
          electrical generation figures, are rarely actually reported by the plants, meaning these figures are more from estimates made by the authors of the dataset instead. </p>
          <h2>Defintions of the categories used within the Dataset</h2>

           <p>The Dataset documentation provided above presents a more detailed breakdown of what percentage of powerplants had information avaible, versues how much had to be estimated,
            or was missing entirely, on page 6. This document is also useful for detailing of the methodology for these estimates, as well as explaining why some catergories may have missing data.
